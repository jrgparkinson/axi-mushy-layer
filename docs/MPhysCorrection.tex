\section*{MPhys Report correction}
%The results presented in figure 7(a) of my MPhys project are incorrectly interpreted in relation to the results of previous studies. This led me to the erroneous conclusion that my model has not produced results which highlight the differences between axisymmetric and planar geometries, when in fact it has.

In my analysis, I compared the results of figure 7(a) with those of Rees Jones and Worster (2013) figure 15(a) and Wells, Wettlaufer, and Orzsag (2013) figure 5(a). In both of these studies, the authors plotted the maximum solute flux as a function of $Rm$, which produced a linear relationship in planar geometry and a nonlinear relationship in axisymmetry. In my figure, I instead plotted the solute flux at fixed $R$ which is roughly linear, but didn't notice that what I was plotting was different from previous authors. I concluded that my results did not display the expected nonlinearity because they are at large $Rm$, where the effect is lessened. This is incorrect. The reason my plots differ from those of Rees Jones and Worster is that I plotted a different quantity. If I had actually plotted maximum solute flux, I would indeed have seen a nonlinear relationship. It is possible to see this in figure 7(a); join up the points with greatest $F/R$ at each $Rm$, and you see that the gradient of the curve you are drawing is increasing.
